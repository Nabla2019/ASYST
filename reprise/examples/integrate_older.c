/*	
 *	Description: 	Example of RLM integration with an older license mgr
 *
 *		This example illustrates how to integrate RLM in code
 *		that uses a different license manager.  The idea is that
 *		both license managers can be used, at the ISV's choice for
 *		a particular customer.
 *
 *		The strategy is:
 *
 *			1. request the RLM license.  
 *			2. If the request succeeds or results in a license in 
 *			   the queue, assume RLM licenses are in use, and
 *			   proceed with the application.  If the license is
 *			   queued, there should be some indication to the user.
 *			3. All other errors are divided into errors that
 *		 	   indicate RLM is being used, and those that indicate
 *			   that the older license manager is in use.
 *			   In the first case, report the RLM error, in the
 *			   second case, no RLM error should be displayed; 
 *			   instead revert to the old behavior.
 *			4. If using RLM licenses, call the appropriate
 *			   RLM functions (checking status, checkin, etc) where
 *			   the calls are placed to the older license manager.
 *			   (Note: item #4 is not illustrated in this source
 *			    file).
