 *	- if RLM_ROAM is set to a positive number, and there is currently
 *	  no roaming license on this computer, the checkout call
 *	  will check out a floating license which will at the same time 
 *	  create the roaming license.
 *
 *	- if RLM_ROAM is 0 (unset), the checkout will get a floating license 
 *	  if one is available, otherwise it will use a roaming license if
 *	  there is one.
 *
 *	- if RLM_ROAM is positive and there is currently a roaming license 
 *	  on this computer, the checkout will get the roaming license.
 *
 *	- if RLM_ROAM is negative, any roaming license on this computer will
 *	  be returned.
 *
 *	Note that in all cases where a roaming license is to be used,
 *	this client must be able to check out an "rlm_roam" license.
 *	The example license file has this license, so if you disconnect
 *	this computer from the network after you have created the roaming
 *	license on it, you must be sure that the example license file is
 *	accessible so that the rlm_roam license can be checked out.
 *	Another way to test this is to simply stop the license server
 *	and the checkout will succeed if you have previously caused a
 *	license to roam.
