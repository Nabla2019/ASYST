      function fpoir (ftemp, comp)
c
c     fpoir returns poisson's ratio for uo2 and mixed oxides
c
c     fpoir = output poisson's ratio for uo2 (unitless)
c     ftemp = input fuel temperature (k)
c     comp  = input plutonia content (weight percent)
c
c     poisson's  ratio for uo2 used in this routine was evaluated
c     from the mean of the data presented by wachtman et al., j. nuc.
c     mat. 16 (1965) pp 39-41
c     poisson's ratio for mixed oxides is the value determined by nutt
c     and allen, j. amer. ceram. soc., 53 (1970) p 205
c
c     fpoir was originally coded by v.f. baston in march 1974.
c     fpoir was modified by c.s. olsen in feb 1975.
