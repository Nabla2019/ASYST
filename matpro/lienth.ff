c
c      this routine calculates the enthalpy of lithium as
c      a function of temperature. it returns also the flag
c      ierr that is set to 0 normally but to 1 if the
c      input temperature lies outside the range 300 k
c      to 4000 k. note that no matter what the input temperature
c      is, an enthalpy is still returned.
c      inputs to this are t and tref. tref is the reference temperature
c      at which the enthalpy is calculated. this is normally 298 k but
c      if the user wishes another reference temp that is fine. note that
c      if t .le. 298.0 or if t .lt. tref, then the returned value of
c      h is zero.

c       construct the following table so that the function

c       for enthalpy as function of temperature.

c       this data is from page appendix a-6 of cronenberg's report
c       entitled "handbook of material melt properties",
c       report no. esa-scdap-101, april 1989. the units there
c       were cal/g for enthalpy and k for temperature. thus, here
c       where si units are required, the enthalpy table has been
c       multiplied by 4184.0 to give j/kg.
