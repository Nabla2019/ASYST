      function emfess (ftemp)
c   femiss calculates fuel emissivity as a function of temperature.
c   ftemp=input fuel temperature(k)
c   femiss=output fuel emissivity(unitless,ratio of radiance)
c   the emissivity relationship used in this subroutine is a fifth
c   order polynomial fit to the tabulated data presented by j.belle
c   (900k<ftemp<2300k):  reference; u02 properties and nuclear
c   applications,by j.belle p.197.
c   femiss was coded by v.f.baston in march 1974.
c   coding revised by r.c.young  nov 74.
