      function emfpir (ftemp)
c   fpoir returns poisson's  ratio for uo2.
c   ftemp=input fuel temperature(k).
c   fpoir=output poisson's  ratio for uo2.
c   poisson's ratio for uo2 used in this routine was evaluated
c   from the mean of the data presented by watchman et al.
c   reference:watchman et al.,journal of nuclear materials vol.16(1)
c   pp.39-41(1965).
c   fpoir was coded by v.f.baston in march 1974.
      emfpir = 0.316
