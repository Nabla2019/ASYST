      function emfeod (ftemp,fraden)
c   felmod calculates fuel elastic modulus as a function of
c   temperature and fractional density.
c   ftemp=input fuel temperature(k)
c   fraden=input fractional fuel density(ratio of actual density to
c   theortical density)
c   felmod=output fuel modulus of elasticity(n/m**2).
c   the modulus of elasticity relationship used in this subroutine is
c   based on the correlations presented by d. vollath in eurfnr-968.
c   the temperature dependence is given to 1973k,consequently above
c   2000k the routine assumes a constant value of 7.0e8 n/m**2.
c   felmod was coded by v.f.baston in march 1974.
c   recoded by r.c.young, mar 1975.
      if (ftemp.gt.2000.) go to 110
