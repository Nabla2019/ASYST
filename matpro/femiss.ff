       function femiss (ftemp)
c
c      femiss calculates fuel emissivity as a function of temperature.
c
c      ftemp  = input fuel temperature (k)
c      femiss = output fuel emissivity (unitless)

c      femiss was coded by r. e. mason in october 1978.

       femiss = 0.78557 + 1.5263e-05 * ftemp
c
c      the following calculations provide the upper and lower bounds.
c      the upper and lower bounds are not an output unless the user
c      desires to modify the subcode appropriately.
c      femisu is the upper bound
       femisu = femiss * (1. + 0.06796)
c      femisl is the lower bound
       femisl = femiss * (1. - 0.06796)
       return
       end
