       subroutine alcp ( t, cp, ierr )
c
c      this routine calculates the heat capacity of aluminum as
c      a function of temperature. it returns also the flag
c      ierr that is set to 0 normally but to 1 if the
c      input temperature lies outside the range 300 k
c      to 4000 k. note that no matter what the input temperature
c      is, a heat capacity is still returned and in fact will be
c      either the first or last table value when ierr = 1.
c
c      this was written in may, 1989, by s. w. james, a
c      consultant to eg&g idaho, inc.
c modified by j. k. hohorst to include specific heat capacity

c       pol8 may be used to do the linear interpolation
c       for specific heat as a function of temperature.

c       this data is from page 4-4 of cronenberg's report
c       entitled "handbook of material melt properties",
c       report no. esa-scdap-101, april 1989. the units there
c       were cal/g-k for specific heat and k for temperature. thus, here
c       where si units are required, the specific heat table has been
c       multiplied by 4184.0 to give j/kg-k.
