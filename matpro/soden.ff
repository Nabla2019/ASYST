       function soden(sotemp)
c
c     soden calculates the density of the stainless
c     steel oxide during a constant pressure change in temperature.
c     sotemp is the temperature of the stainless steel oxide
c     soden   = output the  density of the stainless steel oxide
c     sotemp  = input temperature of the stainless steel oxide
c     soden was coded by j. k. hohorst, january, 1986.

       implicit none
       real sotemp,soden
c  Local variables.

c
      eps = sothex(sotemp,300.)
      soden = 5200.0 * (1.0 - 3.0 * eps)
