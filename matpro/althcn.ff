       subroutine althcn ( t, tcon, ierr )
c
c      this routine calculates the thermal conductivity of aluminum as
c      a function of temperature. it returns also the flag
c      ierr that is set to 0 normally but to 1 if the
c      input temperature lies outside the range 300 k
c      to 4000 k. note that no matter what the input temperature
c      is, a thermal conductivity is still returned and in fact will be
c      either the first or last table value.

c       construct the following table so that the function
c       pol8 may be used to do the linear interpolation
c       for thermal conductivity as function of temperature.

c       this data is from page 4-7 of cronenberg's report
c       entitled "handbook of material melt properties",
c       report no. esa-scdap-101, april 1989. the units there
c       were cal/s-cm-k for thermal conductivity and k for temperature.
c       thus, here where si units are required, the thermal conductivity
c       table has been multiplied by 418.40 to give si units
c       of kg-m-s**(-3).
