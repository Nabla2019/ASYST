c  flstm(kd)    kg/s   steam flow rate at axial node k of component j.
c                      Index kd is function of axial node number,
c                      component number and which of two possible sides
c                      convection heat transfer and oxidation are
c                      occurring.  The equation for calculating index kd
c                      is defined elsewhere in this table.
c  flwh2(kd)    kg/s   hydrogen flow rate at axial node k of component j
c  tcolc(kc)     K     same as tcols but for inner surface (surface at
c                      location of largest radial node).
