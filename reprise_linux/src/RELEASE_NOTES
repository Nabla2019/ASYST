***********************************************************************

This release fixes bugs P472-P477, P479-P487, and P489-P493.

For each bug, we will indicate which RLM components need to be updated 
for the bug fix.  This indication will be of the form:   
	Fix requires: server
   or
	Fix requires: rlm, settings

This indication will list one or more of the following:

	- client - meaning you have to re-build your application.
	- rlm - meaning you need a new rlm binary (ie, you have nothing
		to re-build)
	- server - meaning you need a new rlm binary if you use the
		generic ISV server settings file, or a new ISV server
		if you use an ISV-specific server binary.
	- settings - meaning you need a new ISV server settings file.


Known Issues in this release
____________________________

On Windows, the Activation Pro setup procedure sometimes does not set 
the file modes correctly.  Once your Activation Pro files are set up,
follow the procedures in the "Security Considerations" section of the 
manual in the "Activation Pro Setup" chapter.

On Windows 7, there is an optional Skype add-on to Firefox that interferes 
with the operation of some TiddlyWiki pages.  To ensure that the RLM 
documentation can be displayed properly within Firefox (on Windows 7), the 
Skype Add-on should not be installed.

For an up-to-date list of issues, see:

What's new
__________

	(See the reference manual for complete descriptions)

      - Dynamic Reservations.  RLM now allows one process to check out 
	a license, reserving it for a specified # of seconds, in order 
	to be reclaimed by another process.  See Dynamic Reservations in
	the Reference Manual for more information.

      -	The specification of a primary server in an rlm_failover_server 
      	license can now omit the port #. If omitted, the default port 
	(5053) is used. See Failover License Servers in the Reference
	Manual for more information.

      -	The .<., .>., .&., single quote(') and back quote(`) characters
      	are now legal characters in the customer field of the license.

      -	The report log INUSE records now include the share handle for 
      	shared licenses.  See the Reportlog File Format section of the 
	License Administration Manual for more information.

      -	The rlmstat command now accepts the -I switch, to display the 
      	ISV-defined data.  See the RLM License Administration manual 
	for more information.

      - The new UUID hostid type is supported on Windows.

New License Keywords
____________________

     -	None.

API additions
_____________

      -	The rlm_product_server() call is added to retrieve the server's 
        hostname.  See rlm_products() in the Reference Manual for more 
	information.

      -	The rlm_act_fulfill_info() call has been added.  
      	rlm_act_fulfill_info() returns everything that rlm_act_keyinfo() 
	returns, plus the expiration date and hostid from the most recent 
	fulfillment. See rlm_act_fulfill_info() in the Reference
	Manual for more information.

      -	The UUID hostid type is added on Windows systems.  The UUID is 
      	the BIOS uuid value.  Generate this hostid with:
	    rlmutil rlmhostid uuid


API changes
___________

     -	The return type of rlm_get_attr_lfpath() has been changed from 
     	const char * to char *.


Options file changes
____________________

     -	None.


Activation changes
__________________

     -	RLM Activation Pro has new features.  Please see the 
     	Activation Pro manual for details.



Problems fixed in this release
______________________________


This release fixes bugs P472-P477, P479-P487, and P489-P493.


P472 -	In actpro, the UUID checkbox in a product definition cannot be saved.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: rlc.

P473 -	Actpro tab- and comma-delimited reports do not have time fields present.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: rlc.

P474 -	In certain circumstances, if a license is checked out, then a 2nd 
	checkout fails, checking in the failed license handle will cause 
	the first license to be checked in with a "client exit" status.  
	If broadcasts are disabled, any bad license file or port@host 
	specification will cause this behavior. If broadcast is enabled, 
	then there must be at least one good license file or port@host 
	to avoid this behavior.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client.

P475 -	In Actpro, when editing an activation key, the "ash_sn" field is 
	updated, and it should not be.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: rlc.

P476 -	rlmanon does not anonomize INUSE records.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: rlmanon.

P477 -	if you roam N licenses then request to roam more than N licenses, 
	the 2nd roam succeeds and overwrites the 1st roam file, making it 
	impossible to return the first roamed licenses.  This 2nd roam 
	will now return RLM_EL_ALREADY_ROAMING as of v12.3BL1.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client.

P479 -	Servers sort licenses correctly on startup, but do not sort 
	correctly after a reread.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: server.

P480 -	Servers pool licenses with a non-zero ID with one with no ID 
	(or a 0 ID)  if everything else matches - these should not pool.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: server.

P481 -	In rlm_activate()/rlm_act_request(), an '&' in the log string will 
	terminate the string.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client, actpro server.

P482 -	If the disk serial number code finds BOTH a disk indicating a 
	virtual machine AND a disk with a valid serial number it doesn't 
	flag the machine as a VM.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client, server.

P483 -	(Java API) RlmHandle.getAvailableProducts() leaks memory.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: java client.

P484 -	In actpro, if the URL isn't set in the database, the "issuer=" 
	string in generated licenses (for ASH or ANH licenses) will be bad.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: actpro license generator.

P485 -	If you call rlm_set_attr_req_opt() then attempt to roam a license, 
	the roam will fail.  (this will affect demo licenses as well).
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client.

P486 -	License files signed on Windows and read on non-Windows machines 
	have a carriage return at the ends of the lines.  If this is in 
	the middle of a string, ie a string that spans lines, the extra 
	carriage return is part of the string as returned to the application 
	when it calls rlm_license_*.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client, server.

P487 -	rehostable hostids on mac do not verify the system hostid.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client.

P489 -	RLM v12.2 allowed &, <, >, ', and ` in the customer= field, but 
	these characters could not be passed into an activation request.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL1.  Fix affects: client, actpro server.

P490 -	Edit license file in the web interface doesn't allow saving of 
	token licenses because they contain <>.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL3.  Fix affects: rlm

P491 -	Rehostable hostids sometimes do not verify correctly.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL2.  Fix affects: client, server.
	
P492 -	When using ISV-defined hostids on systems with > 4 ethernet adapters, 
	the first ISV-defined hostid instance isn't recognized as present 
	in the client machine when checking the license out from the server.  
	The client gets a NOTTHISHOST error when the license is locked to 
	the first ISV-defined hostid.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL3.  Fix affects: client

P493 -	In rlmgen, when one of the optional parameters is options, entering a 
	value with embedded spaces (with or without enclosing in double 
	quotes) causes a BADPARAM error when the license is generated.
        This is fixed in v12.3BL3.  Fix affects: rlmgen
