       ftime   - FORTRAN callable integer function to return date
                 and time-of-day
 
       Author:   F. L. Thomas, EG&G Idaho, Inc.
       Date:     10/91
       Language: AIX C
 
       Calling sequence:
 
                 n = ftime (cp1)
 
       Parameters:
 
                 cp1 = date = character*26 string containing
                              time-of-day and date information
                              (output)
 
       This routine was originally named getdate, changed to ftime
       to reflect FORTRAN callable counterpart of AIX C callable
       routine ctime.
