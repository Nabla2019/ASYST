       subroutine  strpu1 (a,s,it,err)
c
c
c  Computes thermodynamic properties as a function of pressure and
c  internal energy when the saturation temperature is not already
c  known.

c
c      Calling sequence:
c
c                call  strpu1 (rp1,rp2,ip3,lp4)

c      Parameters:
c
c                rp1 = a   = steam tables (input)
c
c                rp2 = s   = array into which the computed
c                            thermodynamic properties are stored
c                            (input,output)
c
c                ip3 = it  = flag indicating physical state of fluid,
c                            i.e., liquid, vapor, superheated vapor
c                            (output)
c
c                lp4 = err = error flag (output)
